        <p>Send us a request. We will remove all your entries from the database. However, this option might take some
            time
            since
            we need to manually trigger this action (up to 5 working days).<br>Also this will only remove your ID from
            our
            database. It will not refresh events that you have signed up for! This means that you are listed in those
            events
            until the event gets reloaded (for example a new user signs up).</p>
