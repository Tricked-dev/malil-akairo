{!### First of all:

What data do we store and why?

### User specific data:

To store your iq.

### How do we use your data?

We use this data to:  
To display access data about the iq command

### How do we store your data?

### Can I delete my data?

In short: Yes!  
However, we want to point out that your data is crucial for the bot to operate correctly. If you, for what ever reason, decide that you want your **data deleted**  
Your iq command will reset

### That said; If you want that we erase your data you have the following options:

Send us a request. We will remove all your entries from the database. However, this option might take some time since we need to manually trigger this action (up to 5 working days).  
Also this will only remove your ID from our database. It will not refresh events that you have signed up for! This means that you are listed in those events until the event gets reloaded (for example a new user signs up).
